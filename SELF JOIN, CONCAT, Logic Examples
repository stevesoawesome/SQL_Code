--Alternated the list to show a list of members and who referred them instead.

SELECT
	CONCAT(rec.firstname, ' ', rec.surname) as "member_name",

/*
The key factor here is visualizing the table that results from the self join.

This new table takes the recommended by number from the 'recs' table and matches it to the memid from the 'mem' table.
It then combines the two lines, so that you have a result like so:
memid | name of member | etc | memid (the person recruited) name of member (the person recruited) | recommended by #.

From that we can see that table mem's half of the data is the name of the person who did the recruiting.  Table rec's
half of the data contains the person that was recruited.  We can then select the names appropriately for the output.
