/*

Request to retrieve a list of customers who have not paid their invoices, so that a specialized team can reach out to them and try to recover the payments.

Key deal here is the ability to:
-Set the time frame
-Remove demo/tester accounts
-Avoid invoices attached to previous ones/escalated cases
-Do not provide the same customer info multiple times, to avoid creating a list where they are contacted repeatedly
-Ensure that only valid invoices are considered, avoid testers or "free" orders
-Avoid listing invoices that were cancelled, these will be closed before the invoice was due
