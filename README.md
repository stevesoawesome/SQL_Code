## About Me & SQL:
It feels odd to say, but I really love SQL.  During breaks, I like to solve SQL problems.  I especially love learning a new function and throwing myself at it, trying to understand all aspects and use cases for it.  I can honestly say my day is all the more exciting when I can reverse engineer SQL queries and walk away really understanding how it works and why it worked.
